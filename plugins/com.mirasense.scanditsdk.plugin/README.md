BarcodeScannerPlugin
====================

Cross platform Phonegap/Cordova Plugin of the Scandit Barcode Scanner SDK for iOS and Android

Follow the detailed instructions below to add a high-performance barcode scanner to your app in 5 min.

If you don't have a Phonegap app yet, we will show you how to generate a sample app below.  


Scandit Barcode Scanner SDK Plugin Integration via the Cordova Command Line Interface (CLI)
------------------------

The easiest way to install the Scandit Barcode Scanner plugin into your Phonegap/Cordova project is to use the [Cordova CLI](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.4.0/guide_cli_index.md.html#The%20Command-Line%20Interface).

* Install [Cordova CLI](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.4.0/guide_cli_index.md.html#The%20Command-Line%20Interface) if it is not already installed.
* [Sign up](http://www.scandit.com/pricing) and download the [Scandit Barcode Scanner SDK](http://www.scandit.com/barcode-scanner-sdk/) Cordova Plugins for iOS and Android from your Scandit account. Unzip the zip to a folder of your choice.

* Generate a sample Cordova project or use your existing Cordova project

To generate a sample project, use the following command line commands:
```
	cordova create helloworld
	cd hello world
	cordova platform add ios
	cordova platform add android
```

* Install the [Scandit Barcode Scanner](http://www.scandit.com/barcode-scanner-sdk/) Plugin using [Cordova CLI](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/3.1.0/guide_cli_index.md.html#The%20Command-line%20Interface)

```
        cordova plugin add  <path to downloaded,unzipped ScanditSDK Plugin for Phonegap/Cordova>
```

* Start using the Scandit Barcode Scanner SDK in your html code
    * Get the app key from your Scandit account
    * Invoke the Scandit Barcode Scanner by invoking the cordova.exec() function with the following parameters:

	`cordova.exec(function(success), function(cancel), "ScanditSDK", "scan", ["ENTER YOUR APP KEY HERE",{}]);`

    * See [Scandit Barcode Scanner SDK Documentation](http://docs.scandit.com) for the full API reference.


* Important:

    * if you decide against using the packaged zip with the Scandit Phonegap/Cordova plugin from the downloads page of your Scandit account and
      use the github src of the plugin instead (not recommended!), you will need to copy the libraries and resources from the native Scandit SDK
      builds for iOS and Android to the locations specified in the plugins.xml file.

    * note that there is a serious bug in Cordova 3.4.0 that does not allow you to build your app with Xcode 5.1/Cordova 3.4.0 on an iPhone 5S with an arm64 slice (http://shazronatadobe.wordpress.com/2014/03/12/xcode-5-1-and-cordova-ios/). A workaround until the Cordova bug fix release 3.4.1 will become available is to remove the "arm64" slice from the build settings in your Xcode project.
